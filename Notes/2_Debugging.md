# Source Map
	- Javascript files generated after the compilation of typescript files support source map
	- Source Maps are little addition, the CLI adds to our .js files which allows the browser to translate our .js code to .ts code in development in developer console.
	- To directly access .ts file, go to webpack/./src/app    ----> In developer console >> Sources

	- Angular Augury NOT found   ---->>> A debugger tool for Angular
